#React Dev Framework
This is a barebones framework for developing a quick react app.

To start, simply `npm i` and then `npm start`.

To build the bundle for deployment, run `npm run build` and this will put the bundled JS file in the public folder.


All of the webpack and babel config files are in the root, so it's easy to see what exactly is going on.
